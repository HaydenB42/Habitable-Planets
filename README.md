# Habitable-Planets
This project is taking data from NASA's Kepler Telescope and breaking down the data to find Earth-like habitable planets.

The data from NASA's Kepler telescope has been downloaded to a CSV file and then we use the "csv-parse" package from NPM.

To execute the program you run "index.js" in the terminal.
